Javalanche Tasks

 Javalanche provides several tasks. Most of them are described in
 the documentation on how to run Javalanche and in the examples. This list
 provides an overview over all tasks. The tasks rely on the properties as
 explained in the section on  {{{documentation.html} running Javalanche}}. 
 
* analyzeResults         

 Analyzes the mutation test results. Own analyzers can be specified with <<<javalanche.mutation.analyzers>>>. 
 Note that the own analyzers must be on the classpath.

* cleanJavalanche

 Deletes all files produced by Javalanche. In its standard
 settings these are all files in the folder <<<mutation-files>>>. Note that this
 task does not delete data from the database. This is done in other tasks.

* createMutationMakefile

 Creates a Makefile for the mutation tasks. The created Makefile calls a 
 script called <<<runMutations.sh>>>. 3 Arguments are passed to this script.
 The first is the name of the task file. The second is the the task number.
 The third is an optional argument, that can be passed to the <<<createMutationMakefile>>> task via the property <<<makefile.add>>> 
 An example <<<runMutations.sh>>> file looks like follows:


+-------------------------------+
#!/bin/sh
MYANT="ant"
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/sun-jdk-1.6.0.20/
OUTPUTFILE=mutation-files/output-runMutations-${2}.txt
BACKOUTPUTFILE=mutation-files/back-output-runMutations-${2}.txt
if [ -e $OUTPUTFILE ]
then
	mv $OUTPUTFILE ${BACKOUTPUTFILE}
fi
NICE_VAL='-10'
X=0
while  ! grep -q ALL_RESULTS ${OUTPUTFILE}
do
        then
                echo "Task ${2} not completed - Starting again ${X}"
        else
                echo "Starting Task ${2} "
        fi

	nice ${NICE_VAL} $MYANT -f javalanche.xml runMutations ${3} -Dmutation.file=${1}  2>&1 >> $OUTPUTFILE
        X=$(($X+1))
        sleep 1
done
+-------------------------------+


* createTasks

 Creates mutations task files. 

* createTasksFixed        

 Create a fixed number of tasks. In its standard configuration it creates 10 
 tasks. A different number of tasks can be specified with the property
 <<<javalanche.fixed.number.of.tasks>>>.

* deleteMutations 

 Delete mutations for this project.

* deleteResults           

 Delete mutation results from the database. Either an id of a mutation or file 
 with ids is passed via the property <<<javalanche.delete.results.arg>>>.
 If no arg is passed to this task, all mutation results for this project are
 deleted.

* runMutations            

 Run the mutation task specified by <<<mutation.file>>>.

* scan                    

 Scan the project for mutations.

* scanProject             

 Scan this project for classes to mutate and tests, that are not mutated. 
 This tasks searches recursively for <<<.java>>> from this directory in order 
 to detect test classes. If the sources are not reachable from this directory, 
 a different start directory can be supplied with property <<<javalanche.test.base.dir>>>

* schemaexport

 Exports the hibernate schema to the database. This task needs to be run once 
 after a database was set up.

* showMutation            

 Show the mutation with given id (-Dmutation.id= ) and its results. 

*  startHsql

 Starts a HSQL database.

* stopHsql

 Stops the HSQL database.

* testTask1               

 Tests the Javalanche task. The task should behave in the same way as a regular test task.

* testTask2               

 Tests the Javalanche test runner without any bytecode modifications. All tests should pass in the Javalanche test runner.

* testTask3               

 Run the tests multiple times in different order. The outcome of the tests should not depend on the execution order.
